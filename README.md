# Front End Web Development - D277

<h2>Introduction<h2>
To be successful as a front-end web designer or developer, you must be able to structure content in HTML and present a visual representation of the structure for various devices using CSS and JavaScript. In this task, you will further design, develop, and implement the low-level comprehensive page layout you created in the previous task. Your work for Task 2 will not be evaluated until Task 1 has been submitted and passed.

In this task, you will have the opportunity to demonstrate your HTML and CSS skills as well as your ability to implement user-centered solutions by creating a website about one of the states within the United States. As you create your website, you will use an external style sheet for the design and layout of the site. Each page should have the same layout to maintain a consistent user experience throughout the site. You will publish your website to one of the free hosting sites listed in the Web Links section.

You are now ready to develop the new website for the state government office.
